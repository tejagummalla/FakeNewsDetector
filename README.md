# Fake News Detector Bot

With the recent rise in fake news, I decided to learn and build a model to detect fake news. The app consists of two modules the Chat Bot and the Detector module. The Chat Bot is trained to have general coversation and detect various intents including bit not limited to greetings, compliments.The detector model is trained locally on a list of articles under a certain topic, with tags that define if they are fake news or not. The model achives around 91% accuracy with articles under the trained topics.
